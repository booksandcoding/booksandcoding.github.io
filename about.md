<p>Hello there, I'm Harvey. I am a human male. I've been blogging here since February 2015, and I mainly talk about adult and YA fiction (and also some nonfiction, too, because everybody needs a few facts in their lives). I started blogging when I realised people around me can get a bit annoyed with me screaming at them about books, so I thought I'd come on here and scream at <i>you</i> instead.</p>
<br />
<p>I love to read fantasy, contemporary, historical fiction and the odd bit of sci fi. I also enjoy coding, baking, writing, languages and watching pandas sneeze.</p>
<br />
<p>My favourite books are 1Q84 by Haruki Murakami, The Guest Cat by Takashi Hiraide, Only Every Yours by Louise O'Neill and The Rehearsal by Eleanor Catton.</p>
<br />
<p>I live in England with my dog who doesn't want to be named (he's shy) and am fiercly anti-tory and anti-coffee cake. I don't like olives - that's not relevant but I thought you should know.</p>
