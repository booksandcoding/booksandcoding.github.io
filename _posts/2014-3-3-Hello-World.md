title: Cursed Child Is Out In Less Than A Week (And I'm Nervous)
tag: discussion

Ooh, Cursed Child is out in less than a week. You can't miss it. Every potterhead in the country is screaming about it. I've got the script pre ordered from Waterstones and I payed a whole fucking SEVEN POUNDS for first class delivery. And I'm beginning to get nervous. It's not that I don't want to read it - I can't wait - I just don't want to read it and, well... not like it.<br />
<h2>I really don't want to my favourite series - the books that introduced me to reading - get screwed up.</h2>
I like the Harry Potter books. I <i>love </i>the Harry Potter books. They first introduced me to reading when I was six and since that moment I've hardly been anywhere without a book in hand. They opened up a world of reading and books and magic to me and I'm pretty sure I'm always going to love them for that.<br />
<br />
I don't have a problem with scripts. In fact, some of my favourite books are playscripts. I realise there probably won't be the same feeling to it - but I <i>really want to enjoy it</i>. I'm just worried that this might the book/play where J.K.Rowling fucks up. (And that's not mentioning the fact that most of it <b>isn't</b>&nbsp;written by Rowling herself).<br />
<br />
&nbsp;Is it going to be as good as the Harry Potter series? Is it going to be able to introduce a whole new generation to reading? (Probably not - the book is just a script). Or is this brilliant world that I've been wanting to join for most of life suddenly going to come crashing down? Is the whole thing just going to feel like a money-making scheme, capitalizing on the popularity of the original series? <i>Because it feels a bit like that.&nbsp;</i><br />
<br />
