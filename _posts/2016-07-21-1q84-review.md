<br />
<p>There's something really special about this book that I can't put my finger on.</p>
<p>On the one hand, it's pretty well written - but I wouldn't say it's the best stuff I've ever read. Pretty average. But then, one you
read further into the story, there's something about it that's so much <i>deeper</i></p><br />
<h2>The style, everything about it, it's... hypnotic</h2>
<p>It's super easy to get wrapped up in the plot. It's mad, but it works: it's all kind of like if you asked a 4 year old "and now what 
happens?"; you end up with a really mad story that shouldn't make sense. <i>But it does.</i> And what's more, the whole style is written 
really dreamily - it's got a dark intriguing feel, but it's really <i>minimalist</i>, somehow.</p>
<br />
<p>I'm struggling to describe it. Basically, you need to read it to know what I mean. It's not for everyone, and certain parts do get 
tedious, but when I finished this I found that <i>no other book</i> took my fancy, because there's something special about this book.</p>
<br />
<p> This is ironic, because the book is actually about a really hypnotic book that everybody loves but they can't work out <i>why</i>.</p>
