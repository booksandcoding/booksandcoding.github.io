Right. Now. Well. This is awkward isn't it? Because I'm about to get very angry with the series that was BASICALLY MY CHILDHOOD.<br />
<br />
First of all, let's make it clear that I <b>haven't </b>seen the play - I've just read the script. Let's make it clear that, yes, I do know what a script is and <b>no </b>I wasn't expecting it to be a novel and <b>no </b>at no point was I expecting it to be anywhere near a novel. But I <b>was </b>expecting something of a coherent plot.<br />
<br />
I <i>have </i>read scripts before. In fact, one of them is my favourite books (perhaps <i>ever</i>). So I <i>did </i>understand what I was letting myself in for.<br />
<br />
Let's just say there's a theme emerging here - that everybody who's actually seen the play seems to enjoy it. So maybe you <i>do </i>need to see it. I've heard it's got some pretty amazing tricks in it. And yeah, people are saying that you need to see it to understand it. My view is: yeah, you can have great actors and stunts and lights and whatever, but you've still got that story. I would say <i>plot </i>but to me it was nonexistent. You can roll a turd in glitter but you can't really polish it, now, can you?<br />
<i><br /></i>
Everybody loves the play - and that's great. But with the script you get the plot. And nothing but the plot. And if, like me, you found the plot to be the most utterly despicable crime against the Harry Potter series, then it's not really going to work out is it. <br />
<h4>
Voldemort + Bellatrix = I can't get that image out of my head.</h4>
HELP MEEEEEEEEEE. Voldemort <i>having sex? </i>Ugh. I just find it entirely unrealistic, on hundreds of levels, and also have an image seared into my brain that I would give anything to get rid of.<br />
<br />
To be honest, it wasn't as if it wasn't even predictable. The idea of Voldemort having a child was brought in pretty early, and so was Delphi. In fact, I spent most of my time reading wondering whether she was Voldemort's daughter and <i>jesus christ surely Rowling has a better plot twist than that up her sleeve?</i><br />
<br />
On the subject of Delphi, I thought her character development was non-existent, she herself entirely predictable, and the way she was (eventually) defeated pathetic.<br />
<br />
Some say that they would have preferred Voldemort to have been left out entirely, and I sort of agree. Bringing him back did seem very obvious. I was sort of &nbsp;hoping for a new plot line altogether. However it <i>was </i>good to see the aftermath of the war e.t.c and how the ministry was handling it, even if it was only mentioned briefly.<br />
<h4>
Scorpius and Draco - I enjoyed their relationship immensly, and thought it was the best part of a bad script.</h4>
I think the best part of the script. Or at least the best part of a bad bunch. Scorpius and Draco - unlike pretty much any other character - were pretty well developed, and I enjoyed seeing their relationship. I also enjoyed Scorpius and Draco's relationship and how <i>that </i>developed, over the course of what-wasn't-really-a-plot-but-an-excuse-to-make-money. Ahem. Scorpius stole the show, basically.<br />
<br />
I also sort of enjoyed the relationship between Albus and Harry - and I liked how maybe their relationship is bad. Almost every other character I felt was undeveloped. Scenes seemed to go by very quickly, and speech didn't flow brilliantly. Ugh.<br />
<h4>So yeah, it was the plot.</h4>
To me, it didn't work. It didn't make sense. So I <i>can </i>see why people say the play needs to be seen. I expect with the play - with all the bells and whistles - everything's good. But with the script you just get the story - which I thought was ridikulus. (I'm never getting tired of that joke). It didn't fit with the series at all - <i>where was Teddy Lupin?????? </i>Deathly Hallows made it clear that he was a pretty big part of the story.<br />
<br />
Time travel, I thought, was too much of a factor. It was slightly interesting to see time meddled with and whatever - but I still would have preferred not to have read it and have an untarnished view of the original series.<br />
<br />
Basically, I thought the plot was too predictable. In fact, there was hardly a plot at all. I know it wasn't all written by Rowling but it's hard to believe any of the actual story came out of her head at all. If it was something of a small spin off it wouldn't be so bad - but it's being advertised as the <b>8th story</b>. I wasn't expecting a novel - or anything of the kind - but I <i>was </i>expecting a script that took me back into the wizarding world and had a story that I could <i>enjoy. </i>New characters seemed really underwritten and undeveloped. Ugh. I feel so bad saying this. I just thought it was pretty terrible.<br />
<br />
I'm now going to go and hide in a hole and avoid all those Potterheads who will now be searching for me with pitchforks.<br />
