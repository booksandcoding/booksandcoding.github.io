<p>Hey there! Want to get in touch? I'd love to hear from you!</p>
<p>Send all enquiries to: <b>bookmarkedblog@outlook.com</b></p>
<br />
<p>Want me to review your book?</p>
<br />
<p>That's great - I can't wait!</p>
<br />
<p><b>I can't accept ebooks or self published books.</b></p>
<br />
<p>I don't accept self published books, so unfortunately I can't review your book if it's self published. Also, I only review hardcopies 
of books, not ebooks. This isn't personal - I just don't like reading of my Kindle.</p>
